# Title Management App

## Key Features

- **Login & Registration**: Users can securely log in or register using their email and password.
- **JWT Management**: Session management is handled through JSON Web Tokens (JWT), ensuring secure user sessions across the app.
- **Title Management**: Users can view, add, and delete titles directly from the dashboard.
- **MetaMask Integration**: Connects with MetaMask via Ethers.js to retrieve the userâ€™s wallet address. Only users with a connected MetaMask wallet can add or delete titles, providing an additional layer of user verification.
- **Component Testing**: Component (e.g., register form, add title form) is covered by unit tests, ensuring functionality and reliability.
